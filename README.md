There doesn't seem to be a single Linux `ls` override package to show a directories contents, color formatted for things like dot files.

This binary fixes that. 

Simply run `build.sh` to create the binary on your system using golang which will also add it to your path. 

Then, alias `ls` to `ls-override`.
